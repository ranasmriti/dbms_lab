/* 7. Create a view, which contain employee names and their manager
Using Employee Database above perform the following queries
a) Determine the names of employee, who earn more than their managers.
b) Determine the names of employees, who take highest salary in their departments.
c) Determine the employees, who are located at the same place.
d) Determine the employees, whose total salary is like the minimum Salary of any
department. 
e) Determine the department which does not contain any employees. */

-- 1. Create Dept and Emp tables
CREATE TABLE Dept (
    deptno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dname VARCHAR(50),
    loc VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Emp (
    empno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ename VARCHAR(50),
    job VARCHAR(50),
    mgr INT,
    hiredate DATE,
    sal DECIMAL(10, 2),
    comm DECIMAL(10, 2),
    deptno INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (deptno) REFERENCES Dept(deptno),
    FOREIGN KEY (mgr) REFERENCES Emp(empno) -- Self-referencing for manager
);

-- 2. Insert data into Dept and Emp tables
INSERT INTO Dept VALUES (10, 'Accounting', 'New York'), (20, 'Research', 'Dallas'), (30, 'Sales', 'Chicago');
INSERT INTO Emp VALUES (7839, 'KING', 'President', NULL, '1990-06-09', 5000, 0, 10), 
                       (7566, 'JONES', 'Manager', 7839, '1995-06-13', 2975, 0, 20), 
                       (7698, 'BLAKE', 'Manager', 7839, '1996-08-15', 2850, 0, 30);

-- 3. Create view for employee names and managers
CREATE VIEW Emp_Manager_View AS
SELECT E.ename AS Employee_Name, M.ename AS Manager_Name
FROM Emp E LEFT JOIN Emp M ON E.mgr = M.empno;

-- a) Employees who earn more than their managers
SELECT E.ename FROM Emp E JOIN Emp M ON E.mgr = M.empno WHERE E.sal > M.sal;

-- b) Employees with highest salary in their department
SELECT E.ename FROM Emp E WHERE E.sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM Emp WHERE deptno = E.deptno);

-- c) Employees in departments at the same location
SELECT E.ename FROM Emp E JOIN Dept D ON E.deptno = D.deptno WHERE D.loc IN (SELECT loc FROM Dept GROUP BY loc HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

-- d) Employees whose total salary equals the minimum salary in their department
SELECT E.ename FROM Emp E JOIN Dept D ON E.deptno = D.deptno WHERE (E.sal + COALESCE(E.comm, 0)) = (SELECT MIN(sal) FROM Emp WHERE deptno = D.deptno);

-- e) Departments with no employees
SELECT D.dname FROM Dept D LEFT JOIN Emp E ON D.deptno = E.deptno WHERE E.deptno IS NULL;
